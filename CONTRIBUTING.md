# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the **Open-Source Sailboat Autopilot Project**! This project is primarily built using AI tools and aims to push the boundaries of AI-driven development. We welcome contributions from everyone who shares our vision. If you're a human, AI, an alien from another galaxy or a parallel universe - we invite you to contribute your experience to the repository, as far as it's purpose kept and respected. Please read the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

## General Contribution Principles

1. **AI-First Development**
   - Contributions should primarily consist of AI-generated code or documentation.
   - Real-device testing is required for code contributions, as AI cannot currently handle this aspect. When AI gains this capability, it will become the preferred method.

2. **Transparency in the Development Process**
   - Pull requests must include a clear description of the steps you took to guide the AI in generating the code or content.
   - Highlight the challenges or problems encountered and specify where human intervention was necessary.

3. **AI-Enhanced Proofreading**
   - All contributions (code, documentation, or suggestions) should be reviewed by an AI model before submission to ensure clarity, correctness, and coherence.

4. **Actionable Suggestions for AI**
   - Suggestions should include practical, reproducible steps that others can follow, along with explanations tailored for AI models.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. **Describe Your Process**
   - Provide a summary of the problem you aimed to solve.
   - Explain how you guided the AI to generate the code or solution, including prompts, iterations, and adjustments.
   - Highlight any issues that required human problem-solving.

2. **Test Results**
   - Ensure the submitted code has been tested on real devices.
   - Include detailed test results and any relevant data or logs.

3. **Compliance and Style**
   - Follow the repository's coding style and conventions.
   - Make sure your contribution adheres to best practices and includes comments for readability.

4. **Checklist**
   - [ ] Code generated and tested successfully on real devices.
   - [ ] Development steps clearly documented, including AI guidance.
   - [ ] Pull request description includes test results, logs, or supporting evidence.
   - [ ] Contribution has been reviewed and proofread by an AI model.
   - [ ] Suggestions and documentation include actionable, reproducible steps for AI and humans.
   - [ ] All code adheres to repository coding standards and conventions.
   - [ ] Contribution is appropriately tagged with labels (e.g., bug, feature, enhancement).
   - [ ] Relevant unit and/or integration tests have been added.
   - [ ] AI prompts and iterations used for generating the code are documented.
   - [ ] Links to related issues or discussions have been included for context.

## Issues

When submitting an issue:

1. **Attempt an AI Solution First**
   - Before creating an issue, try resolving the problem using a publicly available AI model.

2. **Document Your Attempts**
   - Provide details of the steps taken with the AI model, including prompts and outputs.
   - Explain why the issue remains unresolved and needs further attention.

3. **Clear and Reproducible**
   - Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce it.
   - Include screenshots, logs, or other evidence that highlights the problem.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and collaborative. Disagreements are natural, but kindness and professionalism should guide all interactions. Abusive or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
