# What is this?

This code in this version created in attempt to evaluate ability of ChatGPT to create useful code on interesting topic. I selected boat autopipot on embedded system as an example to learn capabilities and illustrate them.

## The goal

Is to create yet another opensource autopilot but heavily assisted by AI. In the roadmap 

## Current state

As for the date of this commit the code is compiling. I'm intending to make it work, but currently don't have enough parts to properly test it. When order arrives, I'll get to it. 

## How to contribute
You can create PRs, test, improve, discuss. I will appreciate all the feedback

 - [ ] Add unit tests that run with `pio test`
 - [ ] Define electronic connections and protocols
 - [ ] Make the initial theoretically working version of the code
 - [ ] Build and test working prototype
